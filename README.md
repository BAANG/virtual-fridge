# Fridge
As young adults, we spend hundreds of dollars eating out when we could 
easily make food with the ingredients at home.

FRIDGE allows users to:

    - Store and keep track of the ingredients in their fridge 
    - Search for recipes based on the ingredients in the fridge 
    - Look for nearby grocery stores to purchase the missing ingredients needed 
      for the recipe
